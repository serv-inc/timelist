** Managed Policy
   To modify the list of allowed sites, you need to set a managed
   policy. See
   https://www.chromium.org/administrators/configuring-policy-for-extensions.

   E.g. on Linux, you can add the following to your
   =/etc/chromium/policies/managed/config.json= (or another file in
   that directory).

   #+BEGIN_SRC js
     "3rdparty": {
       "extensions": {
         "iplmogomomicjamihdpekpgcefblbnfk": {
           "blocks": [ {
             "whitelist": "duckduckgo.com|youtube.com",
             "starttime": "0000",
             "endtime": "2359"
           }, {
             "whitelist": "duckduckgo.com",
             "starttime": "0800",
             "endtime": "1500"
           } ]
         }
       }
     }
   #+END_SRC

   This would generally allow only addresses containing /duckduckgo.com/ and
   /youtube.com/.

   From 08:00 to 15:00, /youtube.com/ would be blocked as well.
