* timelist
  Blocks everything except whitelist.
** Managed Policy
   To modify the list of allowed sites, you need to set a managed
   policy. See
   https://www.chromium.org/administrators/configuring-policy-for-extensions.

   On Linux, f.ex. you can add the following to your
   =/etc/chromium/policies/managed/config.json=

   #+BEGIN_SRC js
     "3rdparty": {
         "extensions": {
             "iplmogomomicjamihdpekpgcefblbnfk": {
                 "whitelist": "(youtube\\.com)"
             }
         }
     }
   #+END_SRC
